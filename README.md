Version 1: https://github.com/Mikaelia/TrailFinder

## Motivation
TrailfinderV1 was first crack at building a React web application. I've decided to improve the application by refactoring my code and design with what I have since learned

## Features
This application is built with React, and styled with CSS/Sass instead of CSSModules. I used Firebase's user authentication, and database tools.

In this version of Trailfinder, I removed Redux because I felt that it was unnessary for an application of this size, and wanted to practice working with Firebase without Redux. 

TrailFinder2 includes a Facebook OAuth login option, trail search filters, and an automatically updating, and provides users with a pre-populated trail list based on their geolocation. 

This app can:
- [x] Allow you to create your own account, and login with either email/pass or via Facebook
- [x] Return a list of trails near you, based off of your geolocation
- [x] Show users their distance to listed trails
- [x] Give you the power to pre-filter the trails that are returned, and select your own region on a map to search for trails
- [x] Let users select and save your favorite trails, which may then be viewed in the "Trailmarks" section of the application

Goals:
- [] Provide modal on "detail" link on saved trails, which will show more trail details, pictures, and a directions to trailhead
- [] Create necessary alerts for user interaction
- [] Sort trailmarks options
