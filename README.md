#TrailFinder 2

Welcome to trailfinder v2!

My first trailfinder app represented my first dive into React. Looking back on it after a bit more learning, I've decided to completely rebuild, and see what I can come up with a couple months later!

### Goals

- Remove Redux (it's not really necessary)
- Convert hapdash CSS Modules styling to Sass
- Revamp UI for a better experience
- Create a responsive layout
- Handle asynchronous calls properly
- Include better error handling
- Provide user alerts
- Give users more options in regards to trails

  and more to come!
